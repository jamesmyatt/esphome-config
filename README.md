# ESPHome Config

Repository for my ESPHome configuration packages and devices.
Aim is to organise, refactor, modularise and share configs.

This repo is divided as follows:

- **Boards**: Bare MCU modules and dev kits
- **Packages**: Reusable building blocks for features.
- **Devices**: Complete device configurations
