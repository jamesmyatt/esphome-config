# https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/ESP32-S3-Zero
# Chip is ESP32-S3FH4R2
# 4MB Flash (Quad SPI), 2MB PSRAM (Quad SPI)

# This is effectively the same as the devkit,
# But:
#   - uses a SoC rather than SoM
#   - uses GPIO21 for RGB led
#   - without the USB-UART bridge

packages:
  - !include
    file: ../esp32s3-devkit/base.yaml
    vars:
      flash_size: 4MB
      psram_mode: quad
      rgb_pin: GPIO21

# Note that uart0 doesn't have onboard USB bridge

logger:
  # Use native USB
  hardware_uart: USB_SERIAL_JTAG
